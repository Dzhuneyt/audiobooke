# Frontend

This is the user-facing side of the audibooke.com website. It is based on Angular.

## Getting started with development
Start the lite server with `npm run start` and navigate to http://localhost:4200 to use the built-in lite server.

If needed, configure the "backend URL" in src/environment/environment.dev.ts (the default configuration doesn't require it though).

## Running tests

While developing tests: `npm run test`

In a CI environment (no watch mode, headless browser): `npm run test:cli`
